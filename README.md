# Pneumonia_CNN 

# Pneumonia Detection using CNN

## Description
This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the detection of pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model aims to assist in the healthcare industry, particularly in the radiological department, by providing an automated tool for accurate and efficient pneumonia diagnosis.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the necessary packages using:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Pneumonia_CNN
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Pneumonia_CNN.ipynb
    ```

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed results and visualizations can be found within the notebook.

## Conclusion
This model can be deployed to X-ray machines in the radiological department to assist radiologists in predicting pneumonia from chest X-ray images accurately and efficiently.
